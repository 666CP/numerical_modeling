Some oceanographic numerical modeling code in Matlab and Fortran

* I wrote the lake model in its entirety.  It's based on Lake Kauhako on the island of Molokai.
* I also wrote much of the barotropic ocean model.
* The Zebiak-Cane ENSO model was written back in the 80's and is essentially the first numerical model to capture the physics of ENSO realistically.  I modified a few hundred lines of code for my thesis experiments.
